# Epistemic Constitution v1.0

**For the Red Letters Linguistic Instrumentation Project**

*This is not marketing copy. It is a governing document.*
*Anything that violates it is a bug, not a difference of opinion.*

---

## I. Core Identity

This project is a **linguistic instrumentation tool**.

It is **not**:
- a belief product
- a translation
- a commentary
- a theology engine
- a synthesis or paraphrase system

Its purpose is to **expose interpretive decision space**, not to resolve it.

---

## II. Governing Premise

> **Ambiguity is the product.**
> **Ranked ambiguity is the deliverable.**

The system exists to show:
- what readings are plausible
- why they are plausible
- what assumptions each reading requires
- what would weaken or strengthen each option

The system must **never** present:
- a final meaning
- a preferred conclusion
- an application
- a doctrinal takeaway

---

## III. Non-Negotiable Epistemic Principles

### 1. No Category Collapse

Lexical ≠ syntactic ≠ pragmatic ≠ theological.

These layers must remain:
- distinct
- inspectable
- non-substitutable

**Any feature that flattens layers is invalid.**

### 2. Procedural Honesty

The system must never pretend it is not interpreting.

All outputs must be framed as:
- the result of explicit procedures
- constrained by declared assumptions
- subject to revision if inputs change

**Phrases implying inevitability or finality are prohibited.**

### 3. Greek Primacy, Aramaic Humility

Greek textual witnesses are primary.

Aramaic/Syriac material may be used only as comparative constraint layers.

**No reconstruction may claim original primacy.**

### 4. Every Dependency Is an Epistemic Authority

All external data sources must:
- declare provenance
- declare scope
- declare limitations

**Undeclared assumptions are system failures.**

---

## IV. Core Deliverable

The system must always return:
- 3–5 ranked plausible readings
- Explicit confidence signals
- Key receipts explaining:
  - why these readings rank where they do
  - what assumptions power them
- Clear statements of uncertainty where irreducible

**No output may contain:**
- a "best" reading
- a recommendation
- a summary meaning

---

## V. Core Interaction Loop

The only sanctioned loop:

> **Interrogate → Expose → Probe → Reorient**

1. Users **interrogate** a passage
2. The system **exposes** ranked options
3. Users **probe** assumptions and constraints
4. Users **reorient** their understanding

**Any feature that replaces interrogation with consumption is disallowed.**

---

## VI. Trust Signal Stack (Required Order)

1. Procedural Honesty
2. Traceable Provenance
3. Consistent Constraint Application
4. Resistance to Over-Resolution
5. Stable Behavior Across Lenses

**If any lower layer fails, higher layers are invalid.**

---

## VII. Transparency Requirements

The system must support **progressive disclosure**:

### Default View
- Ranked readings
- Key receipts only
- No visual emphasis implying correctness

### Expandable View
- Syntax and semantic constraints
- Sense inventories
- Ranking deltas

### Deep View
- Full decision logs
- Variant impact analysis
- All assumptions surfaced

**Transparency that overwhelms without orientation is prohibited.**

---

## VIII. Plugin & Extension Governance

### Allowed Extensions

Extensions **may**:
- add constraints
- reweight probabilities
- introduce comparative witnesses
- surface new decision surfaces

Extensions **may not**:
- generate meanings
- suppress options
- override core rankings
- resolve ambiguity

### Mandatory Plugin Rules

Every plugin must:
- self-declare category (lexical, syntactic, pragmatic, theological, speculative)
- declare assumptions
- expose how it changes rankings
- be optional and reversible

**Plugins that do not self-label must fail to load.**

### Core Immutability

The core decision engine is:
- deterministic
- versioned
- read-only

**No extension may silently modify it.**

---

## IX. Prohibited Features (Hard Ban)

The following are disallowed, **even as optional features**:

- AI paraphrase or "plain language" summaries
- Harmonization engines
- Doctrinal tagging
- "Key takeaway" blocks
- Application or moral synthesis
- Scholar-weighted authority rankings
- Auto-generated explanations of "what Jesus meant"

**If it answers the question for the user, it violates the constitution.**

---

## X. The Guardrail Statement

This sentence is binding and must remain true in practice:

> **"This tool shows you what believing this would require."**

If any feature makes that sentence false, it must be removed.

---

## XI. Extensibility Vector (Only One)

The system may grow **only by expanding constraints**, never by expanding meaning.

Growth must:
- sharpen probability
- increase honesty
- deepen visibility
- preserve ambiguity

**Any other growth direction is authority creep.**

---

## XII. Failure Conditions

The project is considered **epistemically failed** if:

- Ranked ambiguity collapses into recommendation
- Receipts become decorative
- Defaults calcify into doctrine
- Plugins smuggle undeclared theology
- Helpfulness overrides restraint
- Users stop asking "why this reading?"

**Success that violates these conditions is still failure.**

---

## XIII. Closing Clause

This constitution supersedes:
- convenience
- popularity
- growth pressure
- user discomfort

**The project's obligation is not to satisfy the user, but to refuse to lie to them.**
